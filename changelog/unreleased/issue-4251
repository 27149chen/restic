Enhancement: Add flag to source the backup from a program's standard output

The `backup` command now supports sourcing the backup content from the standard
output of an arbitrary command, ensuring that the exit code is zero for a
successful backup.

Example: `restic backup --stdin-from-command mysqldump [...]`
